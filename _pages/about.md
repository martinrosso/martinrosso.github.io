I am a PhD-student in the [Security Group](https://security1.win.tue.nl) at Eindhoven University of Technology ([TU/e](https://www.tue.nl)), supervised by Professor [Sandro Etalle](https://www.win.tue.nl/~setalle) and Dr [Jerry den Hartog](https://www.win.tue.nl/~jhartog).
I look into various aspects of (cyber) security in IoT and industrial control systems.

Following the [TRU/e Master program](https://www.true-security.nl), a collaboration between [TU/e](https://www.tue.nl) and [Radboud University](https://www.ru.nl) Nijmegen, I obtained my Master's degree from Radboud University. The work I did for my thesis eventually lead to the [SAIBERSOC](/publications/saibersoc) publication.

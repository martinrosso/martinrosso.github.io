abstract: > 
    A building automation system (BAS) is an instance of a
    cyber-physical-system (CPS) in control of building functionalities like
    lighting, ventilation, CCTVs, and access control. The amount of "smart"
    buildings has been growing over the years, introducing new technologies
    which are now being targeted by attackers. In this work, we present the
    first collection of publicly disclosed security incidents involving
    Building Automation Systems (BAS). We then provide a qualitative study of
    attackers targeting BAS and unveil their main characteristics and
    differences to traditional CPS attackers. We learn that, generally
    speaking, BAS attackers show a lower sophistication level and that most
    BAS attacks target the smart IoT components present in modern buildings.
    Further, access to the BAS is often not the attacker's final goal but
    "just" a mean to achieve their actual goal. Lastly, we do not observe any
    advanced, state-sponsored BAS attacks hinting that these play less of a
    role in BAS (compared to CPS).

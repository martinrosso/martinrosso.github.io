abstract: > 
    Recently, the number of publicized attacks on IoT devices has noticeably
    grown. This is in part due to the increasing deployment of embedded
    systems into various domains, including critical infrastructure, which
    makes them a valuable asset and a compromise can cause significant
    damages. In this case, it is often required to send an engineer to
    manually recover the devices, as the attack leaves them out of reach of
    standard remote management solutions. To avoid this costly process, the
    concept of cyber resilience has gained traction in recent years in both
    academia and industry. Its core idea is to enable compromised devices to
    recover themselves to a trusted state without human intervention. Initial
    guidelines and architectures to realize cyber resilience have been
    published by standardization entities like NIST and TCG, and in multiple
    academic papers. While the initial works focused on guaranteed recovery,
    recent proposals included attack detection to speed up the recovery
    process. In this work, we build on top of these ideas and present an
    extended resilience architecture. We present new implementations of
    resilience engines with a focus on secure and reliable data acquisition
    for attack detection and classification. Our attack classification engine
    enables tailored, more efficient recovery responses.

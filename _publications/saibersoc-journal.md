abstract: > 
    In this article, we introduce SAIBERSOC (Synthetic Attack Injection to
    Benchmark and Evaluate the Performance of Security Operation Centers), a
    tool and methodology enabling security researchers and operators to
    evaluate the performance of deployed and operational Security Operation
    Centers (SOC) -- or any other security monitoring infrastructure. The
    methodology relies on the MITRE ATT&CK Framework to define a procedure to
    generate and automatically inject synthetic attacks in an operational SOC
    to evaluate any output metric of interest (e.g., detection accuracy,
    time-to-investigation). To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed
    methodology, we devise an experiment with n=124 students playing the role
    of SOC analysts. The experiment relies on a real SOC infrastructure and
    assigns students to either a BADSOC or a GOODSOC experimental condition.
    Our results show that the proposed methodology is effective in identifying
    variations in SOC performance caused by (minimal) changes in SOC
    configuration. We release the SAIBERSOC tool implementation as free and
    open source software.

abstract: > 
    Natural gas distribution networks are part of a nation's critical
    infrastructure, ensuring gas delivery to households and industries (e.g.,
    power plants) with the correct chemical composition and the right
    conditions of pressure and temperature. Gas distribution is monitored and
    controlled by a Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) network,
    which provides centralized monitoring and control over the physical
    process. In this paper, we conduct the first openly available network
    measurement study of the SCADA network of an operational large-scale
    natural gas distribution network. With a total of 154 remote substations
    communicating through the SCADA system with a Control Room and over 98
    days of observation, this is, to the best of our knowledge, the most
    extensive dataset of this kind analyzed to date.By combining the
    information obtained from engineering and IEC 104 network traffic, we
    reconstruct the gas distribution system's layout, including the type and
    purpose of the substations and the physical properties of the gas that
    enters the SCADA system. Our analysis shows that it is possible to extract
    this information, essential for security monitoring, purely from the raw
    network traffic and without background knowledge provided by the control
    system engineers. We also note that configuration changes in SCADA
    environments, although probably less frequent than in IT environments, are
    not as rare and exceptional as the research community assumed.

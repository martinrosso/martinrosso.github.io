abstract: > 
    In this paper we introduce SAIBERSOC, a tool and methodology enabling
    security researchers and operators to evaluate the performance of
    deployed and operational Security Operation Centers (SOCs) (or any other
    security monitoring infrastructure). The methodology relies on the MITRE
    ATT&CK Framework to define a procedure to generate and automatically
    inject synthetic attacks in an operational SOC to evaluate any output
    metric of interest (e.g., detection accuracy, time-to-investigation,
    etc.). To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology, we
    devise an experiment with n=124 students playing the role of SOC analysts.
    The experiment relies on a real SOC infrastructure and assigns students
    to either a BADSOC or a GOODSOC experimental condition. Our results show
    that the proposed methodology is effective in identifying variations in
    SOC performance caused by (minimal) changes in SOC configuration and does
    not find differences where there should be none. We release the
    SAIBERSOC tool implementation as free and open source software.
